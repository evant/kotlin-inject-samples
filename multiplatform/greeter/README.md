# Greeter

This is a slimmed down version of the [sample](https://github.com/tfcporciuncula/kotlin-inject-greeter) used in the 
[*From Dagger & Hilt into the multiplatform world with kotlin-inject*](https://proandroiddev.com/from-dagger-hilt-into-the-multiplatform-world-with-kotlin-inject-647d8e3bddd5) article.
While in the original sample we're trying to showcase as many DI features as possible, 
the sample here is simpler and serves merely as an example of a [KMM](https://kotlinlang.org/lp/mobile/) project using kotlin-inject on both Android and iOS.
